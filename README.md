# bbLib
This Repository will consist of a simple libraries to manipulate the available pins on the beaglebone. All edits to these files must be well commented to a point where a
noob can understand the programming. Much of the library will consist of memory mapping, so have the am33xx TRM(Technical Reference Manual) by your side as well as your 
BeagleBone SRM (System Reference Manual). It is also distributed in folders so that you can download the parts that you need such as GPIO, ADC, etc.
