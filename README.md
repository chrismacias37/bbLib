# bbLib
This Repository will consist of a simple libraries to manipulate the available pins on the beaglebone. All edits to these files must be well commented to a point where a
noob can understand the programming. Much of the library will consist of memory mapping, so have a am33xx TRM(Technical Reference Manual) by your side as well as your 
BeagleBone SRM (System Reference Manual)
